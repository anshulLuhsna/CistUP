How to run:

1) Clone into an empty folder
2) RUN docker-compose build
3) RUN docker-compose up
4) Go to localhost:5173

Make sure you have docker setup on your pc.
Frontend runs on port 5173 
Backend runs on port 5000
Make sure both these ports are free before running docker-compose-up

I have used YOLOv3-tiny so that this project will work right out of the box (Due to file size limitations on github). For better results you can download a better weight from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
